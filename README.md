# Spamploy-ee 1.0
"Spamploy-ee, Manage Your Workspace with eases."

After many nights of rendering and tweaking code, he's finally complete in a state that people can use it **without** issues.. _hopefully._

- **How-To-Install?**

If this is your first time using or downloading a Shimeji-ee then please go watch this instead of me trying to explain lol, but all you really need is Java.

**REMINDER!!**
Even though he's currently in a stable state at the moment doesn't mean he's finished, so be aware about that and there will be more updates on him later in the future, but if any issues appear or have any ideas or questions, please let me know!! 

Thanks and have fun!
